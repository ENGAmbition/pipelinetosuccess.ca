## GitHub Workflow

When making changes to the library, you should create a new branch for your changes.

### Making Changes

If you're making changes to a repo on GitHub, copy/paste the following commands when you're making your **first** commit:

```
git checkout -b {your-name/feature}
git add .
git commit -m "New Feature"
git push --set-upstream origin `{your-name/feature}`
git checkout dev
```

REPLACE `{your-name/feature}` with your name and the feature you're adding! If it's not your first commit, use `git push` rather than `git push --set-upstream origin {your-name/feature}`

Then head over to the GitHub repo online and create a pull request from the branch you just created.

After the first commit you don't need to copy/paste the the above again, you can make commits as usual.
